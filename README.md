# Hello, I'm myshkin.

I'm a programmer who enjoys videogames. I work on projects in my spare time. Life is very busy at the moment, but I'm doing what I can.

## Projects

### [SOUND VOLTEX Songlist](https://myshkin.io/sdvx/songlist)

A webpage to view the latest official songlist for SOUND VOLTEX, with title/artist search and level/availability features.

The source code to my website is private, but the script I use to scrape the songlist from both official KONAMI pages can be found [here](https://github.com/myshkin81/sdvx-songlist). There are some low-probability bugs I need to iron out in it (KONAMI's servers sometimes return an empty page!) but it works okay.

## Upcoming projects

- `.ksh` chart parser
- K-Shoot MANIA chart viewer
- SOUND VOLTEX clone?

## Support

You can support me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/myshkin), though right now I haven't done much yet. Still, it would be very appreciated nonetheless.
